I finally started to use github page only because I needed to upload some pictures in the format of http links for my math tutorials, and github page turned out to be a good solution to that. Anyway, I'm still not sure what to post in the future. Nevertheless, this site may serve as my online gratitude journal - something that I haven't done for a while.
